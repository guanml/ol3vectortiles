Simple Openlayers and Bootstrap Client using Vectortiles

This simple webclient shows the usage of openlayers3 and vectortiles, served from a tilestache backend.
As the features are rendered on the clientside, the performance of the map increases with the clients processing power and rendering capabilities of the browser.
Best results can be achieved when using a webkit browser like Chrome / Chromium.

The frontend uses the javascript libraries bootstrap, jquery and openlayers, the backend consists of tilesatche and imposm3, feeded with a planetfile from openstreetmap.
